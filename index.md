My name is Ethan Witwer. I'm currently working as a research assistant at Linköping University, Sweden. You can find my staff page [here](https://liu.se/en/employee/ethwi03){:target="_blank"}.

I’m primarily interested in computer security and privacy, especially in Internet communications. My current research focuses on developing defenses against traffic analysis.

See the links above if you're looking to learn a bit more about the work I've done so far. My contact information also appears at the bottom of every page on this website - feel free to get in touch. If you'd like, you can use [this](/assets/misc/publickey.asc){:target="_blank"} PGP key.
