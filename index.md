My name is Ethan Witwer. I'm currently working as a PhD student at Linköping University, Sweden. You can find my staff page [here](https://liu.se/en/employee/ethwi03){:target="_blank"}.

I’ve spent much of my life programming - starting from when I taught myself Java as a little kid; to my university studies; to my time as a developer working on tests, bug fixes, new features, and tools in C, C++, C#, and Python; to countless scripts, handy tools, and system development in my research.

I have three years of experience with research, development, and teaching related to security. In addition to several publications in security/privacy venues, I’ve had the chance during this time to co-develop Maybenot, the first traffic analysis defense software to see significant (and growing) real-world use.

Some of my favorite work has been my teaching, where I’ve at times been lucky enough to personally see a significant positive impact on students I’ve worked with. Above all, I’m eager to invest my energy into the development of systems that will benefit people and society; systems that will genuinely have a real-world impact.

See the links above if you're looking to learn a bit more about the work I've done so far. My contact information also appears at the bottom of every page on this website - feel free to get in touch. If you want, you can use [this](/assets/misc/publickey.asc){:target="_blank"} PGP key.
