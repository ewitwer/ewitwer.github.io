My name is Ethan Witwer. I'm currently working as a PhD Student at Linköping University, Sweden. You can find my staff page [here](https://liu.se/en/employee/ethwi03){:target="_blank"}.

Professionally, I'm focused on computer security and privacy – I like designing and developing secure systems with practical use cases. My current research is focused on the development of defenses against traffic analysis.

Some of my other interests include learning languages/exploring new cultures and getting to know the world, be it in a big city or out in nature through activities like rock climbing, scuba diving, or just going for a nice hike or bike ride.

On this website, you'll find some of my work as well as some writings and opinions I've thrown in. My contact information appears at the bottom left of every page. Feel free to get in touch!
